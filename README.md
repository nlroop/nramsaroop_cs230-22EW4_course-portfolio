The client, The Gaming Room, has a current application called "Draw It or Lose It" and was
currently only available on Andriod systems. The gaming room wanted to expand their gaming app
to multiple platforms using various software patterns in a distributed evnironment. The company 
wanted to know the best operating platform to deploy the software. A software design document
was created for the client to best determine the best type of system, security, and storage for
the company.

I felt I did particulary well in was understanding the requirements and the design constraints
of the software application. I also did not find it difficult to create the UML diagram because
I was able to identify the Super and Sublclasses of the program. The UML diagram also was the most 
helpful when developing the code because I was able to reference back to it to ensure they were
properly calling from the appropriate class but also creating their own unique ID's depending
on the class. 

If I could choose one part of my work on this document to revise, it would be the evaluation
section. I would spend more time possibly reaching out to the instructor or SNHU tutors to have a 
better understanding of what was being asked in this section. I let my lack of experience with 
other operating systems like MAC and Linux to get the best of me. I had trouble finding exactly
what I was looking for, and understand, which caused a lack of description for my responses.

When working with any client, the users needs is top priority. There is a reason they are reaching
out for a company to help them develop and help them grow their company. It's important to consider 
the users needs when designing because it's the user who will be using the product. If you don't 
include their needs, they won't use the product.

To design the software, the most important thing I did was take it slow and review one class at
a time. I reviewed the code that was already provided and tried to understand how they all connect.
I made sure to review all resources that were provided to me and take notes of things I found 
helpful. I made all errors were clear on the line of code I was working on before proceeding to
the next line of code. As for the design document, I made sure to really understand the design
brief, the client and their needs before starting the design document. Breaking it down into
sections detailing the operating system, storage, design constraints, company needs, and more
help me approach the design software. I would use these same techniques and strategies for
future software applications. Like with anything that is new to me, I always analyze my work
before and after and take note of things I learn along the way. No project will ever be the
same. There is always room for growth and knowledge.
